# Titanic Survival Prediction
This project involves building a predictive model to determine whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not, based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, etc. This is a classic beginner's machine learning project that uses the famous Titanic dataset.
## Project Overview
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

The objective of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers. This involves:
<ol>
    <li><b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</b>: Understanding the dataset and visualizing relationships.</li>
    <li><b>Data Cleaning</b>: Handling missing values and preprocessing data for model training.</li>
    <li><b>Model Building</b>: Training a machine learning model to predict passenger survival.</li>
    <li><b>Model Evaluation</b>: Evaluating model performance using accuracy.</li>
</ol>

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which is publicly available and widely used for educational purposes. It contains the following columns:
<ul>
    <li><b>PassengerId</b> Unique identifier for each passenger</li>
    <li><b>Survived</b> Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)</li>
    <li><b>Pclass</b> Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)</li>
    <li><b>Name</b> Name of the passenger</li>
    <li><b>Sex</b> Gender</li>
    <li><b>Age</b> Age of the passenger</li>
    <li><b>SibSp</b> Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic</li>
    <li><b>Parch</b> Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic</li>
    <li><b>Ticket</b> Ticket number</li>
    <li><b>Fare</b> Passenger fare</li>
    <li><b>Cabin</b> Cabin number</li>
    <li><b>Embarked</b> Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)</li>
</ul>

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:
<ol>
    <li>Clone or download this repository to your local machine.</li>
    <li>Navigate to the project directory: <code>cd AspireNex-Titanic-survival-prediction</code></li>
    <li>Install the required dependencies: <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></li>
    <li>Run the Jupyter notebooks to see the analysis and model building process.</li>
</ol>

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project includes comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset better and visualize key relationships. This step is crucial for identifying patterns and insights that inform the model building process.

## Results
The project demonstrates the use of a machine learning model, evaluated primarily on its accuracy, to predict the survival of passengers.
